## üíª Project
On this challenge, from Rocketseat, he was creating a new application to learn new things and train my knowledge in Node.js with TypeScript, including the use of databases with TypeORM, and ManyToMany relationships.

This will be an application that should allow the creation of customers, products and orders, where the customer can generate new purchase orders for certain products, such as a small e-commerce.
